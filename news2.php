We inherited it. Thanks for that,\" Morocco coach Herve Renard said. \"We have to face these two ogres (Spain and Portugal) and do everything to qualify for the last 16, even if it seems very difficult.\"\r\n\r\nDefending champion Germany will open against Mexico in its quest to become the first country to win back-to-back World Cup titles since Brazil in 1962. The Germans will then face Sweden and South Korea in Group F.\r\n\r\n\"We got opponents that are not unknown to us,\" Germany captain Manuel Neuer said. \"That's what I like best, when we know what to expect.\"\r\n\r\nFive-time world champion Brazil is in Group E with Switzerland, Costa Rica and Serbia.

But the Belgium coach knows England well after spending two decades there as a coach and player.\r\n\r\n\"It is going to be one of those games with no secrets,\" said Martinez, a former Everton manager.
